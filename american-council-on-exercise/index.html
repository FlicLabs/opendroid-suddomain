            </ul>

            <h3>Robotics Opportunity Pathways</h3>
            
            <h4>Pathway 1 – Robotic Rehabilitation & Mobility Gym (Current & Expandable)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Current state: Ceiling-suspended robotic harness systems over specialty treadmills for gait/balance retraining for stroke, TBI, and Guillain–Barré syndrome patients. Recent expansion required roughly $500k in philanthropic funding.</li>
                <li>Value levers: Higher-intensity, higher-repetition gait training; Fewer staff injuries; Ability to treat more complex cases locally.</li>
                <li>ROI considerations: Improved functional outcomes can shorten inpatient rehab stays and reduce readmissions. Donor-funded capital improves effective ROI.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Pathway 2 – Robotic Surgery Platforms (Orthopedics & Beyond)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Current state: Robotic joint replacement (e.g., Mako) for hips and knees; Multi-arm robotic surgery suites for minimally invasive procedures.</li>
                <li>Clinical and economic value: More precise component placement; Shorter length of stay and faster recovery; Enhanced ability to attract and retain surgeons.</li>
                <li>ROI considerations: Justified by maintaining/increasing high-margin surgical volume, reducing perioperative complications, and supporting network-wide case centralization.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Pathway 3 – Data-Driven Optimization Around Existing Robotics (Future)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Concept: Build analytics and AI layers around existing robotic assets to optimize scheduling, utilization, patient selection, and outcome tracking.</li>
                <li>Potential benefits: Higher utilization of expensive robotic capital; Stronger evidence base for payer negotiations; Platform for clinical trials and grants.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Financial & Strategic Implications (High-Level)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rehab robotics:</strong> Single Mobility Gym expansion cost on the order of $500k, funded via philanthropy. Gains come from improved patient outcomes, safety, capacity, and patient experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Robotic surgery:</strong> Capital-intensive but strategically essential. Value created via case retention, growth in robotic specialties, and reduced complications (cost avoidance).</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic positioning:</strong> UVMMC can position itself as the regional robotics hub, combining rehab robotics, surgical robotics, and research on assistive technologies.</li>
