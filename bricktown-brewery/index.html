        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Location Count:</strong> Approximately 15 locations spread across several states.</li>
                <li><strong>Cuisine Type:</strong> American pub fare, including gourmet burgers, pizzas, salads, sandwiches, and appetizers, complemented by a wide selection of house-brewed craft beers.</li>
                <li><strong>Current Service Model:</strong> Full Service Restaurant (FSR), characterized by a sit-down dining experience, table service provided by waitstaff, and a casual, lively atmosphere. They emphasize a high-quality food and beverage offering with a focus on guest satisfaction and community engagement.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>ROBOTICS OPPORTUNITY PATHWAYS</h3>
            <h4>Pathway A: Front-of-House Serving Robots (Focus on Table Turnover & Staff Support)</h4>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Deployment of autonomous mobile robots to assist human servers with tasks such as food delivery from kitchen to table, dirty dish bussing, and condiment replenishment. These robots navigate dining areas efficiently, reducing physical strain on staff and allowing them to dedicate more time to guest engagement, order taking, and resolving complex requests.</p>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased operational speed and efficiency, especially during peak hours.</li>
                <li>Significant reduction in staff fatigue and physical labor, leading to improved morale.</li>
                <li>Faster table turnover rates, directly contributing to higher revenue potential.</li>
                <li>Enhanced consistency in service delivery, ensuring all tables receive prompt attention.</li>
                <li>Frees human staff to focus on personalized service, upselling, and guest relationship building.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Pathway B: Back-of-House Automated Frying/Grilling (Focus on Consistency & Safety)</h4>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Integration of robotic systems designed for precise cooking tasks, such as frying french fries, chicken wings, or grilling burgers and steaks. These systems can consistently execute cooking protocols, monitor temperatures, and ensure optimal doneness, leading to perfectly prepared dishes every time.</p>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unparalleled consistency in food quality and preparation, enhancing brand reputation.</li>
                <li>Improved food safety through precise temperature control and reduced human handling.</li>
                <li>Significant reduction in kitchen accidents and burns, leading to a safer work environment.</li>
                <li>Lower food waste due to accurate cooking and portioning.</li>
                <li>Ability to maintain high output volume during peak times without compromising quality.</li>
                <li>Reduction in mundane, repetitive BOH tasks, allowing skilled chefs to focus on menu innovation and complex preparations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Pathway C: AI-Driven Kiosks or Drive-Thru Voice Agents (Focus on Upselling & Order Accuracy)</h4>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> For Bricktown Brewery, the focus will be on AI-driven self-ordering kiosks positioned at entrances or specific dining zones. These kiosks provide an intuitive interface for guests to browse menus, customize orders, and make payments. Advanced AI algorithms can analyze order patterns and suggest personalized upsells or cross-sells, such as pairing a specific beer with an entree or adding an appetizer. While Bricktown does not typically have a drive-thru, these kiosks can also facilitate quick grab-and-go orders.</p>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased order accuracy, minimizing errors and improving guest satisfaction.</li>
                <li>Automated upselling and cross-selling capabilities, potentially increasing average check size.</li>
                <li>Reduced wait times for ordering, particularly during busy periods.</li>
                <li>Collection of valuable customer data for personalized marketing and menu optimization.</li>
                <li>Reduced labor dependency for order taking, freeing up staff for other duties.</li>
                <li>Multilingual support, catering to a diverse customer base.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Total CAPEX per location: $50,000 + $35,000 + $36,000 = $121,000.</li>
                <li>For 5 pilot locations: 5 x $121,000 = $605,000.</li>
                <li>This CAPEX includes initial software licenses, basic integration, and initial training.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>OPEX Impact (Operating Expenditure):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Target 15-25 percent reduction in Front-of-House labor costs by reducing reliance on manual bussing and food running.</li>
                <li>Anticipated 10-15 percent reduction in Back-of-House labor through automation of repetitive tasks and reduced waste.</li>
                <li>Potential 3-5 percent increase in average check size due to AI-driven upselling.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Target &lt; 14 months.</li>
                <li>Achievable through a combination of:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increased table turnover rates leading to higher revenue per hour.</li>
                        <li>Significant reduction in direct labor costs (FoH and BoH).</li>
                        <li>Enhanced revenue from upselling via AI kiosks.</li>
                        <li>Reduced food waste and improved operational consistency.</li>
                    </ul>
