            <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
            <p>Radia Inc. is a medical diagnostic imaging company based in Kirkland, Washington, specializing in high-field open MRI systems. Its flagship product, the Radia 7.0T, is a 0.7 Tesla (7T) superconducting open MRI scanner that offers high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution within a patient-friendly, wide-bore design. The unique double-doughnut structure with a 28-inch gap enables interventional procedures and accommodates patients with claustrophobia or larger body habitus. Having secured FDA clearance for its 7.0T system, Radia is in the early commercialization phase, targeting ambulatory imaging centers, orthopedic and neurology clinics, and hospital systems. The company’s robotics and automation opportunities focus on three key areas: robotic-assisted patient positioning, AI-driven workflow automation, and image-guided interventional robotics. The primary ROI driver is enhanced throughput and premium pricing, with the potential to generate $15M–$30M in incremental annual revenue per facility at scale, achieving capital recovery in 3–4 years.</p>

            <h3>Model</h3>
            <p>Radia operates as a specialized medical device company focused on designing, manufacturing, and supporting the installation of high-field open MRI systems. The company’s model emphasizes modular, open-architecture systems that reduce the need for extensive facility modifications compared to traditional high-field closed MRI. Revenue streams include direct sales, lease-to-own arrangements, and service contracts.</p>
            <h3>Scale</h3>
            <p>Radia is in early commercialization with FDA clearance granted in 2023. Initial installations are underway at pilot sites, including reference centers and ambulatory imaging facilities. The addressable market includes over 40,000 MRI scanners installed globally, with a significant portion operating at 1.5T or lower field strengths. Target is 50–100 units deployed in 3–5 years across North America and select international markets.</p>
            <h3>Partnerships</h3>
            <p>Radia collaborates with imaging center chains, hospital networks, and technology integrators for distribution and software integration. Partnerships extend to component suppliers for superconducting magnets and cryogenics, as well as clinical research institutions for validating applications in neurology and orthopedics.</p>
            <h3>Economics</h3>
            <p>Capital price point for the Radia 7.0T ranges from $2M to $4M. Gross margins are projected at 40–50%, with profitability achievable at scale with 100+ installed units. Initial funding from venture capital and strategic investors supports a path to cash flow positivity through hardware sales and recurring service revenue.</p>

            <h2>Strategic Positioning</h2>
            <p>Executing this roadmap positions Radia Inc. as a leader in high-field open MRI technology, evolving from a hardware vendor to an integrated diagnostic and interventional platform. By leveraging robotics and AI, Radia can offer faster, more accurate imaging that enhances patient experience and clinical outcomes, differentiating itself in a market dominated by giants like Siemens, GE, and Philips. Radia’s open architecture is uniquely suited for robotics integration, enabling synergies in surgical planning and image-guided therapy. This could lead to strategic partnerships with hospital networks and academic centers, creating an ecosystem that generates recurring revenue from software, services, and high-margin procedures. Ultimately, Radia’s success could redefine the MRI landscape, making high-quality imaging more accessible and efficient while driving substantial financial returns through automation and workflow optimization.</p>
